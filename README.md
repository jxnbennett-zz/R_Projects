# R_Projects
Collection of small R projects dealing with big data analysis and personal interests

## Flights
Small project that takes input airport and identifies all flights to or from that airport over a specified capacity. Idea is that larger flights represent high demand routes and are therefore likely to be relatively cheap.

## Big Data
Examples of using big data techniques in R (datadr and RHIPE/Hadoop) to process data. Data sets are stored in a Purdue cluster, but are both readily available on Kaggle
